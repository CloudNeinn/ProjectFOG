  description: Seven star-like motes of light appear and orbit your head until the
    spell ends. You can use a bonus action to send one of the motes streaking toward
    one creature or object within 120 feet of you. When you do so, make a ranged
    spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 4d12 radiant damage. Whether you hit
    or miss, the mote is expended. The spell ends early if you expend the last mote.
    If you have four or more motes remaining, they shed bright light in a 30-foot
    radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. If you have one to three motes
    remaining, they shed dim light in a 30-foot radius.
